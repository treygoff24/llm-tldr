# TLDR: Code Analysis That Actually Fits In Context

**The Core Insight:** LLMs can't read your entire codebase. So we extract the structure, trace the dependencies, and give them exactly what they need—at **95% fewer tokens** than raw code.

Stop burning context windows. Start shipping features.

---

## The Problem: Context Window Bankruptcy

Your codebase is 100,000 lines. Claude can read ~200,000 tokens. Math says you're already in trouble.

| Approach | Tokens | What You Get |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Read raw files | 23,314 | Full code, zero context window left |
| Grep results | ~5,000 | File paths. No understanding. |
| **TLDR summaries** | **1,189** | Structure + call graph + complexity—everything needed to edit correctly |

**Measured with tiktoken on real codebases.** TLDR gives you 95% token savings while preserving the information LLMs actually need to write correct code.

---

## Quick Start: 30 Seconds to Better Context

```bash
# Install
pip install llm-tldr

# Index your project call graph/cache
tldr warm /path/to/project

# Get LLM-ready context for a function
tldr context process_data --project /path/to/project
```

For embeddings, run `tldr semantic index /path/to/project` explicitly. Hooks and
session warmups do not download semantic models.

### Agent Context Quickstart

```bash
tldr pack "understand auth flow" --project . --budget 3000
tldr hooks doctor
tldr hooks install claude --scope global --dry-run
tldr hooks install codex --scope global --dry-run
tldr hooks install droid --scope global --dry-run
tldr hooks install opencode --scope global --dry-run
```

Hooks provide automatic context and conservative safety checks around supported
client events. Claude Code can inject context before reads and edits. Codex can
inject context around session start and edits, block high-confidence prompt
secret pastes, and deny high-confidence destructive commands through documented
JSON decisions. Droid/Factory use the Claude-style hook config surface for
session/read/edit/prompt/tool/compact events. OpenCode uses a generated JS
plugin adapter, not JSON hook config. Cursor hook support remains disabled and
experimental until a local hook runtime is proven; use Cursor rules/MCP context
for now.

MCP dynamic project configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tldr": {
      "command": "tldr-mcp",
      "args": ["--project", "auto"]
    }
  }
}
```

`--project auto` resolves from agent project environment variables and `PWD`.

---

## What Makes TLDR Different

### 1. Behavioral Search, Not Text Search

**The old way:** Search for `authentication` → find variable names, comments, log messages.

**TLDR semantic search:** Understands what code *does*, not just what it says.

```bash
tldr semantic "validate JWT tokens and check expiration" /path/to/project
```

Finds functions by behavior because **every function is embedded with:**
- **L1:** Signature + docstring
- **L2:** What it calls + who calls it (forward & backward call graph)
- **L3:** Complexity metrics (branches, loops, cyclomatic complexity)
- **L4:** Data flow (which variables are used, how they transform)
- **L5:** Dependencies (imports, external modules)
- **Plus:** First ~10 lines of code

This gets encoded into **1024-dimensional embeddings** via `bge-large-en-v1.5`, so semantic search finds `verify_access_token()` even when you ask about JWT validation.

#### Why Both Forward AND Backward Call Graphs?

```python
# Forward (calls): What does login() do?
def login(user, password):
    hash_password(password)  # <-- calls this
    create_session(user)     # <-- and this

# Backward (called_by): What breaks if we change hash_password()?
hash_password()  # <-- called by: login, reset_password, register
```

TLDR indexes **both directions** so you can:
- Trace execution flow (forward: "what does this call?")
- Impact analysis (backward: "what calls this?")

Both are embedded together, so semantic search like `"password hashing"` finds relevant functions whether they *perform* hashing or *use* hashing.

#### No Filtering: Everything Gets Indexed

Unlike traditional tools that skip "trivial" functions, TLDR indexes **every function, method, and class**—including getters, one-liners, and utilities. Why?

Because LLMs need to understand your entire API surface, not just the "important" parts. And token-efficient summaries make this practical.

### 2. The 5-Layer Architecture: Different Questions, Different Depths

Not every question needs a full CFG analysis. Pick the layer that matches your task:

```
Layer 5: PDG (Program Dependence) → "What affects this line?"
Layer 4: DFG (Data Flow)          → "Where does this value come from?"
Layer 3: CFG (Control Flow)       → "How complex is this function?"
Layer 2: Call Graph               → "Who calls this?"
Layer 1: AST (Structure)          → "What functions exist?"
```

#### Real Example: Debugging a Null Reference

**Question:** "Why is `user` null on line 42?"

```bash
# L5 (PDG): Program slice - show ONLY code that affects line 42
tldr slice src/auth.py login 42
```

**Output:** 6 lines (out of 150 in the function) that actually matter:
```python
3:   user = db.get_user(username)
7:   if user is None:
12:      raise NotFound
28:  token = create_token(user)  # <-- BUG: skipped null check
35:  session.token = token
42:  return session
```

**Before TLDR:** Read 150-line function, trace logic manually, miss the bug.
**With TLDR:** See exactly the execution path, spot the missing null check at line 28.

---

### 3. Daemon Mode: 300x Faster Than CLI Spawns

**The problem with traditional tooling:** Every query spawns a new process, parses the entire codebase, throws away the results.

**TLDR's daemon:** Long-running background process with indexes in RAM.

| Method | Query Time | What Happens |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| CLI spawn | ~30 seconds | Parse entire codebase, build indexes, analyze, return result, exit |
| Daemon query | ~100ms | Read from in-memory index, return result |
| **Speedup** | **300x** | Measured on a 50-file Python project |

#### How It Works

```bash
# First query auto-starts daemon (transparent)
tldr context login --project .

# Daemon stays running, queries use in-memory indexes
tldr impact login .          # 100ms, not 30s
tldr cfg src/auth.py login   # <10ms if cached
```

**Per-project isolation:** Each project gets its own daemon via deterministic socket names:
```bash
/tmp/tldr-{md5(project_path)[:8]}.sock
```

No cross-contamination. Work on 5 projects simultaneously without conflicts.

**Auto-lifecycle management:**
- Starts on first query
- Auto-shuts down after 5 minutes idle
- Restarts on next query (loads from `.tldr/cache/`)

---

### 4. Salsa-Style Incremental Recomputation

**The insight:** When you edit one function, you don't need to re-analyze the entire codebase.

TLDR uses **content-hash-based caching** with automatic dependency tracking:

```python
# You edit auth.py
# TLDR invalidates:
#   - auth.py's AST cache ✓
#   - Functions that CALL auth functions ✓
#   - Call graph edges involving auth.py ✓
# TLDR keeps:
#   - All other files' analysis ✓
#   - Unchanged functions in auth.py ✓
```

#### Before/After: The `tldr warm` Command

```bash
# First run: Full index build
tldr warm /path/to/project
# → Parses 342 files, builds call graph (5-10 seconds)

# You edit 2 files

# Second run: Incremental update
tldr warm /path/to/project
# → Re-parses 2 files, patches call graph (<1 second)
```

**Measured speedup:** 10x for incremental updates vs full rebuild.

---

### 5. Multi-Language Support (Same API)

Tree-sitter parsers under the hood mean **one interface, 16 languages:**

| Language | AST | Call Graph | CFG | DFG | PDG | Semantic* |
|----------|-----|------------|-----|-----|-----|-----------|
| Python | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Full |
| TypeScript | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Full |
| JavaScript | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Full |
| Go | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Basic |
| Rust | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Basic |
| Java | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Basic |
| C | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Basic |
| C++ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Basic |
| Ruby | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Basic |
| PHP | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Basic |
| C# | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Basic |
| Kotlin | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Basic |
| Scala | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Basic |
| Swift | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Basic |
| Lua | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Basic |
| Elixir | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Basic |

**\*Semantic embeddings:**
- **Full**: Embeddings include all 5 layers (signature, call graph, CFG complexity, DFG variables, dependencies)
- **Basic**: Embeddings include signature, call graph, and dependencies, but not CFG/DFG summaries

> **Note:** CLI commands (`tldr cfg`, `tldr dfg`, `tldr slice`) work for all languages. The "Basic" semantic limitation only affects the richness of embeddings used by `tldr semantic search`.

```bash
# Same commands, different languages
tldr context main --project ./go-service --lang go
tldr impact processRequest ./rust-api --lang rust
```

---

## Layer Deep-Dive: What Each One Gives You

### Layer 1: AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) - "What exists?"

**Question:** "What functions are in this file?"

**Token cost:** ~500 tokens for a 500-line file (vs 4,000 raw)

```bash
tldr extract src/auth.py
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "functions": [
    {
      "name": "login",
      "signature": "def login(username: str, password: str) -> User",
      "params": ["username: str", "password: str"],
      "return_type": "User",
      "is_async": false,
      "line": 42
    }
  ],
  "classes": [
    {
      "name": "AuthService",
      "methods": ["login", "logout", "refresh_token"],
      "line": 12
    }
  ],
  "imports": ["from models import User", "import hashlib"]
}
```

**Use case:** Get a file overview without reading it. See what APIs it exposes.

---

### Layer 2: Call Graph - "Who calls what?"

**Token cost:** +440 tokens (cumulative ~940)

#### Forward Calls: What Does This Function Do?

```bash
tldr calls /path/to/project  # Build call graph
```

```json
{
  "function": "login",
  "calls": [
    "db.get_user",
    "hash_password",
    "create_session",
    "send_welcome_email"
  ]
}
```

#### Backward Calls: Impact Analysis Before Refactoring

```bash
# "If I change hash_password(), what breaks?"
tldr impact hash_password /path/to/project
```

```json
{
  "function": "hash_password",
  "called_by": [
    {"file": "auth.py", "function": "login", "line": 47},
    {"file": "auth.py", "function": "reset_password", "line": 89},
    {"file": "registration.py", "function": "register", "line": 23},
    {"file": "tests/test_auth.py", "function": "test_login", "line": 15}
  ]
}
```

**Use case:** Safe refactoring. Know exactly what depends on what.

---

### Layer 3: CFG (Control Flow Graph) - "How complex is this?"

**Token cost:** +110 tokens (cumulative ~1,050)

```bash
tldr cfg src/auth.py login
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "function": "login",
  "blocks": [
    {"id": 0, "statements": ["user = db.get_user(username)"]},
    {"id": 1, "statements": ["if user is None:", "    raise NotFound"]},
    {"id": 2, "statements": ["if not verify_password(...):", "    raise AuthError"]},
    {"id": 3, "statements": ["session = create_session(user)", "return session"]}
  ],
  "edges": [[0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [1,3], [2,3]],
  "complexity": 3
}
```

**What you learn:**
- **Complexity: 3** → This function has 3 decision points (2 if statements = 3 paths)
- **Blocks:** 4 basic blocks (straight-line code between branches)
- **Edges:** Shows which blocks can follow which (for tracing execution)

**Use case:** Find overly complex functions that need refactoring (complexity > 10 = code smell).

---

### Layer 4: DFG (Data Flow Graph) - "Where does this value come from?"

**Token cost:** +130 tokens (cumulative ~1,180)

```bash
tldr dfg src/auth.py login
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "function": "login",
  "variables": [
    {"name": "user", "defined_at": [3], "used_at": [5, 8, 15]},
    {"name": "token", "defined_at": [12], "used_at": [18]},
    {"name": "session", "defined_at": [15], "used_at": [18]}
  ],
  "flows": [
    {"from": "username", "to": "user", "via": "db.get_user"},
    {"from": "user", "to": "session", "via": "create_session"},
    {"from": "session", "to": "token", "via": "session.token"}
  ]
}
```

**Use case:** Debugging. "Why is `token` wrong? Let me trace back through the data flow."

---

### Layer 5: PDG (Program Dependence Graph) - "What affects this line?"

**Token cost:** +150 tokens (cumulative ~1,330)

**The killer feature for debugging:** Program slicing.

```bash
# "What code affects the return value on line 42?"
tldr slice src/auth.py login 42
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "target_line": 42,
  "slice": [3, 5, 12, 28, 35, 42],
  "slice_code": [
    "user = db.get_user(username)",
    "if user is None: raise NotFound",
    "if not verify_password(password, user.hash): raise AuthError",
    "token = create_token(user)",
    "session.token = token",
    "return session"
  ]
}
```

**Before TLDR:** Read 150-line function, manually trace dependencies.
**With TLDR:** See only the 6 lines that actually matter.

**Use case:** Answering "why did this variable have this value?" in complex functions.

---

## Semantic Search: Find Code by Behavior

Traditional search finds syntax. TLDR semantic search finds behavior.

### The Architecture

1. **Extract all functions** (no filtering—getters, utilities, everything)
2. **Build rich embeddings** from all 5 layers:
   ```
   Function: validate_token
   Signature: def validate_token(token: str, secret: str) -> dict
   Description: Verify JWT token signature and check expiration
   Calls: jwt.decode, check_expiration, get_user_claims
   Called by: authenticate_request, refresh_session
   Control flow: complexity 4, 6 basic blocks
   Data flow: 8 variables, token → decoded → claims
   Dependencies: import jwt, from datetime import datetime
   Code:
       decoded = jwt.decode(token, secret, algorithms=['HS256'])
       if decoded['exp'] < time.time():
           raise TokenExpired
       ...
   ```

3. **Encode with bge-large-en-v1.5** → 1024-dimensional vector
4. **FAISS index** for fast similarity search

### Example Queries

```bash
# Find authentication code
tldr semantic "verify user credentials and create session" .

# Find error handling
tldr semantic "catch exceptions and log errors" .

# Find database operations
tldr semantic "query postgres with SQL and parse results" .
```

**Why it works:** The embedding includes:
- What the function does (docstring)
- What it calls (behavior inference)
- Who calls it (usage patterns)
- How complex it is (implementation hints)
- What it imports (technology stack)

So searching for `"JWT validation"` finds functions that call `jwt.decode`, are called by `authenticate_*` functions, and import `jwt`—even if they're named `verify_access_token`.

### Build the Index

```bash
# One-time index build
tldr warm /path/to/project  # Builds the call graph cache
tldr semantic index /path/to/project  # Builds the semantic index explicitly

# Query (uses daemon, ~100ms)
tldr semantic "your natural language query" /path/to/project
```

Results include file path, function name, line number, and similarity score.

---

## Daemon Architecture: Why It's Fast

### The Old Way (Every CLI Tool)

```
You: tldr context login
CLI: Fork process → Parse codebase → Build AST → Build call graph → Return result → Exit
Time: 30 seconds

You: tldr impact login  (2 minutes later)
CLI: Fork process → Parse codebase → Build AST → Build call graph → Return result → Exit
Time: 30 seconds (ALL OVER AGAIN)
```

### The TLDR Way

```
You: tldr context login
Daemon: Auto-starts if not running → Loads indexes into RAM → Returns result
Time: 100ms

You: tldr impact login  (2 minutes later)
Daemon: Reads from in-memory index → Returns result
Time: 50ms

You: (nothing for 5 minutes)
Daemon: Auto-shuts down, writes state to .tldr/cache/
```

### Daemon Lifecycle

| Event | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| First query | Hook auto-starts daemon, indexes load into RAM |
| Subsequent queries | Daemon serves from memory (100ms) |
| File edit | Daemon detects change, incrementally updates affected indexes |
| 5min idle | Daemon auto-shuts down to save resources |
| Next query | Daemon restarts, loads from cache (still faster than parsing) |

### Per-Project Isolation

```bash
# Project A
cd ~/myproject
tldr context main
# → Daemon socket: /tmp/tldr-a3f2c8d1.sock

# Project B (different terminal)
cd ~/otherproject
tldr context main
# → Daemon socket: /tmp/tldr-b9e4d7f3.sock
```

Socket path = `md5(absolute_path)[:8]`, so projects never interfere.

### Daemon Commands

```bash
# Manual control (usually automatic)
tldr daemon start --project .    # Start daemon
tldr daemon stop --project .     # Graceful shutdown
tldr daemon status --project .   # Check health

# Example output
$ tldr daemon status --project .
Daemon running (PID: 42315)
Socket: /tmp/tldr-a3f2c8d1.sock
Uptime: 127 seconds
Files indexed: 342
Cache hits: 89.3%
Semantic index: 1,247 functions
```

### Available Daemon Commands

| Command | Purpose | Latency |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `ping` | Health check | <1ms |
| `status` | Stats (uptime, cache hits, files) | <1ms |
| `search` | Pattern search in code | ~50ms |
| `extract` | Full file analysis (AST) | ~10ms |
| `impact` | Reverse call graph | ~20ms |
| `dead` | Dead code detection | ~100ms |
| `arch` | Architecture layers | ~150ms |
| `cfg` | Control flow graph | ~15ms |
| `dfg` | Data flow graph | ~20ms |
| `slice` | Program slicing | ~30ms |
| `calls` | Cross-file call graph | ~80ms |
| `semantic` | Embedding-based search | ~100ms |
| `tree` | File tree structure | ~20ms |
| `structure` | Code structure (codemaps) | ~30ms |
| `context` | LLM-ready context | ~50ms |
| `imports` | Parse file imports | ~10ms |
| `importers` | Reverse import lookup | ~100ms |

Compare to **30 seconds** per CLI spawn.

## Integration with Agent Hooks

> **Note:** TLDR originated as part of [Continuous Claude](https://github.com/parcadei/Continuous-Claude-v3), which provides Claude hooks out of the box. Standalone TLDR now also targets Codex, Factory Droid, and OpenCode where their hook/plugin surfaces are documented and locally testable.

TLDR integrates via package-owned Python hooks that query TLDR for low-overhead
code understanding. Installable TLDR hooks use `tldr hooks run ...`; OpenCode
uses a generated adapter that shells out to the same runtime:

| Hook | Triggers On | TLDR Operation |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| `session-start` | Session start | Ensure `.tldrignore`, request daemon start, warm small repos |
| `pre-read` | Claude/Droid before Read | Inject a nav map for large code files |
| `pre-edit` | Claude/Droid edits; Codex `apply_patch`/Edit/Write; OpenCode edit callback | Extract file structure for safer edits |
| `post-edit` | Claude/Droid/Codex/OpenCode edit callbacks | **Shift-left validation** - catch type errors immediately |
| `user-prompt-submit` | Codex/Droid opt-in prompt hook | Block high-confidence pasted secrets with a redacted reason |
| `permission-request` / `pre-tool` | Codex/Droid/OpenCode opt-in permission/tool hooks | Deny high-confidence destructive shell commands |
| `pre-compact` | Droid/OpenCode opt-in compaction hooks | Add compact TLDR context where the client supports it |
| `stop`, `session-end`, `notification`, `subagent-*` | Lifecycle hooks | No-op by default unless a future fixture proves safe behavior |

Install examples:

```bash
tldr hooks install claude --scope global --dry-run
tldr hooks install codex --scope global --dry-run --enable-prompt-guard --enable-tool-guard
tldr hooks install droid --scope global --dry-run --enable-prompt-guard --enable-tool-guard --enable-compact-context
tldr hooks install opencode --scope global --dry-run --enable-tool-guard --enable-compact-context
```

Cursor remains deliberately guarded. `tldr hooks doctor --client cursor` reports
`experimental_unverified`, and `tldr hooks install cursor` refuses to write until
a local fixture proves Cursor hook payload/output schema. Until then, TLDR
documents Cursor rules/MCP fallback rather than writing to Cursor app/CLI configs
by default.

### Hook Implementation Pattern

```bash
tldr hooks run pre-read --client claude < claude-hook-event.json
```

**Result:** Claude gets code understanding automatically, without manual commands, without 30-second waits.

### Shift-Left Validation

The `post-edit-diagnostics` hook enables **shift-left validation**—catching type errors at edit time, not test time.

**Traditional flow:**
```
Edit → Run tests → Tests fail → "Oh, type error" → Fix → Run tests again
       └─────────────────── 30-60 seconds wasted ───────────────────┘
```

**With shift-left:**
```
Edit → [hook: diagnostics] → "Type error line 42" → Fix immediately
       └── 200ms ──┘
```

**Why it matters:**
- Type errors are deterministic—no need to "test" them
- Pyright catches errors tests miss (unreachable code, wrong types in unexecuted paths)
- Faster iteration = more attempts per session = better results

The hook is **silent when everything's fine**. Only speaks up when there's a problem worth mentioning.

## CLI Reference

### Core Commands

```bash
# Project setup
tldr warm [path]                      # Build/update all indexes (incremental)

# Structure exploration
tldr tree [path]                       # File tree
tldr structure [path] --lang python    # Code structure overview
tldr extract <file>                    # Detailed file analysis (L1)

# Search
tldr search <pattern> [path]           # Text search in code
tldr semantic <query> [path]           # Behavioral semantic search

# LLM context
tldr context <entry> --project . --depth 2  # Get LLM-ready context
```

### Analysis Commands

```bash
# Call graph
tldr calls [path]                      # Build cross-file call graph
tldr impact <function> [path]          # Who calls this function?

# Control flow
tldr cfg <file> <function>             # Control flow graph + complexity

# Data flow
tldr dfg <file> <function>             # Variable definitions and uses

# Program slicing
tldr slice <file> <func> <line>        # What affects this line?
```

### Codebase Analysis

```bash
tldr dead [path] --entry main cli      # Find unreachable code
tldr arch [path]                       # Detect architecture layers
tldr imports <file>                    # Parse imports from a file
tldr importers <module> [path]         # Find all files that import a module
tldr diagnostics <file|path>           # Type check + lint/format diagnostics
tldr change-impact [files...]          # Find tests affected by changes
tldr doctor                            # Check/install diagnostic tools
```

### Diagnostic Tool Setup

```bash
# Check which type checkers/linters/formatters are installed
tldr doctor
# → Shows installed ✓ and missing ✗ tools per language

# Install missing tools for a language
tldr doctor --install python   # Installs pyright + ruff
tldr doctor --install go       # Installs golangci-lint
```

### Import Analysis

Track dependency relationships across your codebase:

```bash
# What does this file import?
tldr imports src/auth.py
# → [{"module": "jwt", "names": ["encode", "decode"], ...}, ...]

# Who imports this module? (reverse import lookup)
tldr importers validate_input src/
# → {"module": "validate_input", "importers": [{"file": "api/routes.py", ...}, ...]}
```

This complements `tldr impact` which tracks function *calls*—`tldr importers` tracks *imports*.

### Diagnostics (Type Check + Lint)

```bash
# Single file
tldr diagnostics src/auth.py

# Whole project
tldr diagnostics . --project

# Human-readable output
tldr diagnostics src/ --format text
# → Found 2 errors, 5 warnings
# → E src/auth.py:45:12: Expected int, got str [reportArgumentType]

# Type check only (skip linter/formatter)
tldr diagnostics src/ --no-lint
```

Wraps language-specific type checkers, linters, and formatter checks:

| Language | Type Checker | Linter | Formatter |
|----------|--------------|--------|-----------|
| Python | pyright | ruff | - |
| TypeScript | tsc | oxlint | oxfmt |
| JavaScript | tsc (`--allowJs`) | oxlint | oxfmt |
| Go | go vet | golangci-lint | - |
| Rust | cargo check | clippy | - |
| Java | javac | checkstyle | - |
| C/C++ | gcc/clang | cppcheck | - |
| Ruby | - | rubocop | - |
| PHP | - | phpstan | - |

For single-file JavaScript and TypeScript checks, TLDR runs `tsc` through an
ephemeral config that extends the nearest project config and includes only the
target file. That preserves aliases, JSX settings, and other project compiler
options while keeping post-edit diagnostics scoped to the file the agent just
changed.
| Kotlin | kotlinc | ktlint | - |
| Swift | swiftc | swiftlint | - |
| C# | dotnet build | - | - |
| Scala | scalac | - | - |

### Change Impact (Selective Testing)

```bash
# Auto-detect changed files (session dirty flags, then git)
tldr change-impact
# → {"affected_tests": ["tests/test_auth.py"], "skipped_count": 247, ...}

# Explicit files
tldr change-impact src/auth.py src/session.py

# Session-modified files only
tldr change-impact --session

# Git diff
tldr change-impact --git --git-base HEAD~3

# Actually run the affected tests
tldr change-impact --run
```

Uses call graph + import analysis to find which tests are affected by code changes. Run only what matters instead of the full suite.

### Daemon Management

```bash
tldr daemon start --project .          # Start daemon manually
tldr daemon stop --project .           # Stop daemon
tldr daemon status --project .         # Check daemon health
```

---

## Python API

```python
from tldr.api import (
    # Layer 1: AST
    extract_functions,
    extract_file,
    get_imports,

    # Layer 2: Call Graph
    get_call_graph,
    build_function_index,

    # Layer 3: CFG
    get_cfg_context,
    get_cfg_blocks,

    # Layer 4: DFG
    get_dfg_context,

    # Layer 5: PDG
    get_slice,

    # Unified
    get_relevant_context,
)

# Example: Get multi-layer context for a function
context = get_relevant_context(
    entry_point="process_data",
    project_path="./src",
    depth=2,
    layers=["ast", "call_graph", "cfg"]
)

print(context)  # LLM-ready text with structure + call graph + complexity
```

## Performance Numbers (Measured)

### Daemon Speedup: 155x Faster

**What we measured:** Time to complete identical queries via (a) spawning `tldr` CLI vs (b) querying the daemon via Unix socket.

| Command | Daemon | CLI | Speedup |
|---------|--------|-----|---------|
| `search` | 0.2ms | 72ms | **302x** |
| `extract` | 9ms | 97ms | **11x** |
| `impact` | 0.2ms | 1,129ms | **7,374x** |
| `tree` | 0.3ms | 76ms | **217x** |
| `structure` | 0.6ms | 181ms | **285x** |
| **Total** | **10ms** | **1,555ms** | **155x** |

**Why `impact` shows 7,374x speedup:** The CLI must rebuild the entire call graph from scratch on every invocation (~1.1 seconds). The daemon keeps the call graph in memory, so queries return in <1ms. This is the primary value proposition of the daemon architecture.

#### Methodology

```bash
# Benchmark script from Continuous Claude: opc/scripts/benchmark_daemon.py
# Hardware: MacBook Pro M1 Max, 64GB RAM
# Project: tldr-code (26 Python files, ~5,000 lines)
# Protocol:
#   1. Start daemon, let it fully index
#   2. Warm up: Run each query once (not counted)
#   3. Measure: 10 iterations per query, record mean ± stdev
#   4. CLI: Fresh `tldr <cmd>` process each time
#   5. Daemon: Unix socket query to running daemon
```

**Reproduce it yourself:**
```bash
# Clone Continuous Claude for benchmark scripts
git clone https://github.com/parcadei/Continuous-Claude-v3
cd Continuous-Claude-v3/opc/packages/tldr-code
pip install -e .
tldr daemon start --project .
python ../../scripts/benchmark_daemon.py
```

### Token Savings: 89% Reduction

**What we measured:** Tokens required to understand code at different granularities, comparing raw file reads vs TLDR structured output.

| Scenario | Raw Tokens | TLDR Tokens | Savings |
|----------|------------|-------------|---------|
| Single file analysis | 9,114 | 7,074 | 22% |
| Function + callees | 21,271 | 175 | **99%** |
| Codebase overview (26 files) | 103,901 | 11,664 | 89% |
| Deep call chain (7 files) | 53,474 | 2,667 | 95% |
| **Total** | **187,760** | **21,580** | **89%** |

#### What Each Scenario Measures

1. **Single file analysis (22% savings)**
   - Raw: `cat api.py` → 9,114 tokens
   - TLDR: `tldr extract api.py` → 7,074 tokens
   - *Note: Modest savings because extract includes full file structure. Better use case is when you need overview, not full code.*

2. **Function + callees (99% savings)** ← The killer feature
   - Raw: Read 3 files that contain the function and everything it calls → 21,271 tokens
   - TLDR: `tldr context extract_file --depth 2` → 175 tokens
   - *Why so dramatic:* TLDR's call graph navigates directly to relevant code. You don't read irrelevant functions in those files.

3. **Codebase overview (89% savings)**
   - Raw: Read all 26 Python files → 103,901 tokens
   - TLDR: `tldr structure . --lang python` → 11,664 tokens
   - *Trade-off:* You get function signatures and structure, not full implementations.

4. **Deep call chain (95% savings)**
   - Raw: Read 7 files in the call chain → 53,474 tokens
   - TLDR: `tldr context get_relevant_context --depth 3` → 2,667 tokens
   - *Same principle as #2, deeper traversal.*

#### Methodology

```bash
# Benchmark script from Continuous Claude: opc/scripts/benchmark_tokens.py
# Token counter: tiktoken with cl100k_base encoding (Claude's tokenizer)
# Project: tldr-code source (tldr/*.py)
# Protocol:
#   1. "Raw" = cat file(s) and count tokens
#   2. "TLDR" = run tldr command and count output tokens
#   3. No cherry-picking: same files for each scenario
```

**Important caveats:**
- "Raw" assumes reading entire files. In practice, you might grep + read specific sections, which would be somewhere between raw and TLDR.
- Scenarios are chosen to represent real use cases (understanding a function, getting codebase overview), not to maximize savings.
- The 99% savings on "function context" is real but represents the best case (call graph navigation).

**Reproduce it yourself:**
```bash
# Clone Continuous Claude for benchmark scripts
git clone https://github.com/parcadei/Continuous-Claude-v3
cd Continuous-Claude-v3/opc/packages/tldr-code
pip install -e . tiktoken
python ../../scripts/benchmark_tokens.py
```

### Summary

| Metric | Before TLDR | After TLDR | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Query latency | 1.5s | 10ms | **155x faster** |
| Tokens for function context | 21K | 175 | **99% savings** |
| Tokens for codebase overview | 104K | 12K | **89% savings** |

**Cost impact:** At Claude Sonnet rates (~$3/M input tokens), saving 166K tokens per session = ~$0.50/session. Over 1,000 sessions, that's $500.

---

### Legacy Numbers (Reference)

These are older measurements on different projects, kept for reference:

| File Size | Raw Tokens | TLDR Tokens | Savings |
|-----------|------------|-------------|---------|
| 500-line Python | ~4,000 | ~200 | 95% |
| 1000-line TypeScript | ~8,000 | ~400 | 95% |
| 10-file context | ~40,000 | ~2,000 | 95% |

| Operation | CLI Spawn | Daemon (Cold) | Daemon (Cached) |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| `extract <file>` | ~50ms | ~10ms | ~2ms |
| `impact <func>` | ~100ms | ~20ms | <1ms |
| `search <pattern>` | 2-5s | ~100ms | ~50ms |

---

## Cache Structure

TLDR stores all indexes in `.tldr/cache/`:

```
.tldr/
├── daemon.pid               # Running daemon PID
├── status                   # "ready" | "indexing" | "stale"
└── cache/
    ├── call_graph.json      # Forward call edges
    ├── file_hashes.json     # Content hashes (dirty detection)
    ├── parse_cache/         # Cached AST results per file
    │   ├── src_auth.py.json
    │   └── src_db.py.json
    └── semantic/            # Embedding-based search
        ├── index.faiss      # FAISS vector index
        └── metadata.json    # Function metadata for results
```

### Incremental Updates

```bash
# First run: Full index
tldr warm .
# → Parses 342 files, builds call graph (8 seconds)

# Edit 2 files

# Second run: Incremental
tldr warm .
# → Detects 2 changed files via content hash
# → Re-parses only those 2 files
# → Patches call graph edges
# → Updates semantic index for changed functions
# (0.7 seconds)
```

**How dirty detection works:**
1. Compute SHA256 hash of each file's content
2. Store in `file_hashes.json`
3. On next `warm`, compare hashes
4. Re-parse only files with changed hashes
5. Update call graph edges for changed functions

---

## Architecture Decisions: Why These Choices?

### Why Tree-sitter?

- **10-100x faster** than language-native parsers (Python's `ast`, TypeScript's `tsc`)
- **Incremental parsing**: Re-parse only edited portions of files
- **Multi-language**: Same API for Python, TS, Go, Rust, JS
- **Error-tolerant**: Parses incomplete/broken code (handles in-progress edits)

### Why JSON Output?

- **LLM-friendly**: Can be pasted directly into prompts
- **Language-agnostic**: Works with any tooling
- **Human-readable**: Easy to debug and inspect
- **Transformable**: Pipe through `jq` for filtering

### Why Layered Architecture?

Different questions need different analysis depths:

| Question | Layer | Why |
|----------|-------|-----|
| "What functions exist?" | L1 (AST) | Fast, lightweight |
| "Who calls this?" | L2 (Call Graph) | Need cross-file analysis |
| "Is this function complex?" | L3 (CFG) | Need branching logic |
| "Where does this variable come from?" | L4 (DFG) | Need data dependencies |
| "What affects this line?" | L5 (PDG) | Need full dependency graph |

**Pay for what you need.** Don't compute CFGs when you just need function names.

### Why a Daemon?

- **Speed**: Eliminate 30s CLI spawn overhead → 100ms daemon query
- **Memory efficiency**: Load indexes once, reuse for all queries
- **Caching**: Memoization persists across queries
- **Zero config**: Auto-starts, auto-stops, transparent to users

### Why Semantic Search?

Because **text search finds syntax, not behavior.**

```bash
# Text search
tldr search "JWT"  # Finds: comments, variable names, log messages

# Semantic search
tldr semantic "validate JWT tokens"  # Finds: functions that actually validate JWTs
```

Embeddings encode:
- What the function does (docstring)
- What it calls (behavior)
- Who calls it (usage)
- Data flow patterns
- Complexity

So you find code by *what it does*, not just *what it says*.

## Real-World Workflows

### Debugging a Bug

```bash
# 1. Find where the error occurs
tldr search "raise AuthError" src/

# 2. Get the program slice (what code leads to that line?)
tldr slice src/auth.py validate_token 47

# 3. Find all callers (who might trigger this error?)
tldr impact validate_token src/

# 4. Check data flow (where does the bad value come from?)
tldr dfg src/auth.py validate_token
```

**Before TLDR:** Read 5 files (2,000 lines), trace logic manually, guess.
**With TLDR:** Targeted analysis in 4 commands, see exactly what matters.

---

### Before Refactoring

```bash
# 1. Understand current implementation
tldr extract src/utils.py
tldr cfg src/utils.py process_data

# 2. Find all usages (impact analysis)
tldr impact process_data src/

# 3. Check architectural role
tldr arch src/

# 4. Look for dead code to remove
tldr dead src/ --entry main cli
```

**Result:** Confidence to refactor without breaking callers.

---

### Understanding a New Codebase

```bash
# 1. Get overview
tldr tree src/
tldr structure src/ --lang python

# 2. Find entry points
tldr arch src/  # Shows entry/middle/leaf layers

# 3. Trace from entry to implementation
tldr context main --project src/ --depth 3

# 4. Find relevant code semantically
tldr semantic "database queries" src/
```

**Before TLDR:** Read README, grep around, read random files, build mental model.
**With TLDR:** Structured exploration in minutes, not hours.

---

### Adding a Feature

```bash
# 1. Find similar existing code
tldr semantic "user authentication and session management" .

# 2. Understand how it works
tldr context login --project . --depth 2

# 3. Check what depends on it
tldr impact login .

# 4. Find where to add new code
tldr arch src/  # See layer structure
```

**Result:** Implement features in the right place, following existing patterns.

## Why "TLDR"?

Because codebases are **Too Long; Didn't Read**—but LLMs still need to understand them.

TLDR extracts the structure, traces the dependencies, measures the complexity, and gives LLMs exactly what they need to write correct code.

At 95% fewer tokens than raw files.

**Ship features. Don't read documentation.**
